The Template Method defines the steps of an algorithm and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.

Template Method Pattern-

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses
redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
This pattern is all about creating a template for an algorithm. What's a template? It's just a method; more specifically, it's a method that defines
an algorithm as set of steps. One or more of these steps is defined to be abstract implemented by a subclass. This ensures the algorithm's structure
stays unchanged, while subclasses provide some part of the implementation.

We can also have concrete methods that do nothing by default; we call these "hooks." Subclasses are free to override these but don't have to. We're
going to see how these are useful.

In com.templatemethod.pattern.problem package, we can there is lot of duplicacy in code. So we are going try to fix it.
