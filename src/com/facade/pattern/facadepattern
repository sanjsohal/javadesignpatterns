Facade Pattern-

A facade not only simplifies an interface, it decouples a client from a subsystem of components. 

Facades and adapters may wrap multiple classes, but a facade's intent is to simplify, while an adapter is to convert the interface to something
different.

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the 
subsystem easier to use.

The Principle of Least Knowledge-

Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends. It means when you are designing a system, for any object, be careful of the 
number of classes it interacts with and also how it comes to interact with those classes. This principle prevents us from creating designs that 
have coupled a large number of classes coupled together so that changes in one part of the system cascade to other parts. When y ou build a lot of 
dependencies between many classes, you are building a fragile system that will be costly to maintain and complex for others to understand. This 
principle is also called Law of Demeter.
