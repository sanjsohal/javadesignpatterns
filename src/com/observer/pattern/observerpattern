Observer Pattern
-Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern
-The Observer Pattern defines one to many dependency between objects so that one object changes state, all of its dependent objects gets
notified and updated automatically.
-Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
-Loosely coupled designs allows us to build flexible Object Oriented  systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency
between objects.
