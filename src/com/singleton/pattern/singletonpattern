Singleton pattern ensures that a class only has one instance and provide global point of access to it. In multi-threaded applications, we can
ensure that a class only has one instance by making the method which return instance synchronized or using eager initialization method or using
double checked locking. Double checked locking technique is better than synchronized method technique because synchronized method keeps lock on 
the method without ensuring that it has already created object or not and on the other hand double checked locking ensures that method will only
have synchronized lock unless it have not created object.
