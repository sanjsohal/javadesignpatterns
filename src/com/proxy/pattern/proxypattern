Proxy Pattern-

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Use the Proxy Pattern to create a representative object that controls access to another object which
may be remote, expensive to create, or in need of securing.

There are three types of proxy-

Remote Proxy - A remote proxy controls access to a remote object.
Virtual Proxy - A virtual proxy controls access to a resource that is expensive to create.
Protection Proxy - A protection proxy controls access to resource based on access rights.
