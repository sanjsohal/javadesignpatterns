The Open-Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
What Open Closed Principle states seems contradictory. We can't extend a class without modification. But there are some time tested Ojbect Oriented
techniques which allows us to extend without modifying. For example in observer pattern, we are adding new Observers to a subject without altering
the code of Subject. This is one of the example. Be careful while choosing the area of code that needs to be extended, because applying Open Closed
Principle everywhere is wasteful and unnecessary as this can lead to complex and hard to understand code.
Designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements.


Decorator Pattern
-Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for
 extending functionality.
