Currently Starbuzz coffee has various outlets. They are using an ordering system which is designed as shown in classes in this package.

Now there is requirement that anyone can ask for condiments like steamed milk, soy and mocha and have topped off with milk. In their first attempt,
they tried to make several classes to calculate cost of beverage with condiments. Some of the classes that they attempted was
HouseBlendWithSteamedMilkandMocha, DarkMilkWithSteamedMilkandMocha, DecafWithSteamedMilkandMocha, DarkRoastWithWhipandSoy, DecafWithWhipandSoy etc.
There will be a class explosion as they have to make many classes to calculate cost of different combinations. Each of these new classes will 
calculate cost of coffee with condiments. This will create a maintenance nightmare for Starbuzz in two conditions i.e.
-What to do when the price of milk go up?
 As per current approach, we have to make change in many places. So it will be a maintenance nightmare.
-What to do when there is new topping let us say, carmel?
As per current design, we have to create many number of classes as mentioned above in class explosion. We have to create new class with carmel 
and other combinations.
